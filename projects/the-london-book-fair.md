FSU's digital humanities MA degree is a 2-year degree hosted in the Program in Interdisciplinary Humanities. The program is highly flexible and individualized to suit each student's chosen specialty within the large field of possibilities open to digital humanists. There are a series of core classes where students learn essential digital humanities skills for data analytics (DH 1: Humanities Data), knowledge curation (DH 2), and for communicating and teaching (Digital Pedagogy). Students are also part of a growing and vibrant community of digital humanities scholars across many departments and schools of the university, including the Office of Digital Research in the University Libraries and the Digital Scholars group sponsored by the History of Text Technology Program in the Department of English.
