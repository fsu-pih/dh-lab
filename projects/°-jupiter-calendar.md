The Demos Project fosters and supports scholarship involving structured data around people (the _demos_) and their environment. At Demos, we examine the mis/representation of individuals and communities in data, we ask and answer questions about data in society, and we apply humanistic thinking to data-driven problems. In so doing, we build upon FSU’s historic strengths in intersectional studies of race, gender, language and society, with one of the Project’s goals being the retention and recruitment of a more diverse cross-section of faculty and graduate student participants.
